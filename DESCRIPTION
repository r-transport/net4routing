Description: Convert osm.pbf files for *edge*/*node* representation inside R.
    This allows for customizable use, for example, in packages like `cppRouting.
    Further, the package includes various profiles to control the routing 
    behavior on a segment level (*car*, *bike*, *truck* and further profiles),
    as well as the inclusion of custom weights based on raster source (traffic,
    capacity, disruptions, ...).
